A single-header math library for graphics and games in C.

Originally a bad joke about the C preprocessor,
alg.h is unfortunately something I now use on a daily basis.
It prefers quaternions to matrices, lexical economy to verbosity,
and specificity to abstraction.

Overall, the two main design goals of alg.h are
(1) to make writing math in jam scenarios as fast as possible
and (2) to ensure its source code is maximally unreadable.

Note: this repo was ported over from
https://github.com/acgaudette/txtquad
(where it previously lived) on 05.07.21.
